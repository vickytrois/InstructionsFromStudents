# InstructionsFromStudents
 Some code my English for IT students helped me write.
 
 ##My knowledge background in IT
 April 1st I'm taking lesson 02 of Dell and Lead's Immersion4Women Introduction to Java course. This is a lesson on data primitive types, methods, some basic comands, such as loops and data structure and their semantics in Java), and arrays.
 So far, I've covered the data types content and have started the one which highlights the differences in syntax from structured Portuguese and Java.
 I'm also taking Senac's System development Technician Course, but in a distant education format. We're studying databases now, haven't got to Java yet.
 
 ##My students' background in IT and English
 This group is on the second module of Senac's System Development Technician Course (Presential format). In their first module they covered requirements gathering, agile methodologies, programming logic, introduction to databases and Java and an English subject that focused on receptive skills. Now, in the second module, they are studying about JavaSwing and Git and GitHub.
 
 BibiDeBem gave me instructions to code the DivisionCalculator file and TiagoCassol instructed me into writing the BmiCalculator one.
 Both of them used English to comunicate. AND our codes **DO** RUN :)
